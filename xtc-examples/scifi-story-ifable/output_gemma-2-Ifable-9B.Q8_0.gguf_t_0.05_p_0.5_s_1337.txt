Science Fiction: The Last Transmission - Write a story that takes place entirely within a spaceship's cockpit as the sole surviving crew member attempts to send a final message back to Earth before the ship's power runs out. The story should explore themes of isolation, sacrifice, and the importance of human connection in the face of adversity. 800-1000 words.

The crimson numerals on the auxiliary console blinked a mocking countdown: 00:03:47. Each flicker was a heartbeat, a frantic pulse echoing the desperate thrumming in Captain Eva Rostova's chest.  Outside her viewport, the tapestry of a billion stars was a desolate beauty, mocking the abyss of silence swallowing her ship, the *Logos*,  her only remaining sanctuary. A cosmic graveyard, the *Logos* now was,  a tomb orbiting a dead sun, a silent testament to a mission gone tragically wrong.

Three weeks. It had been three agonizing weeks since the Xylos swarm, a sentient, crystalline tempest, had ripped through their exploratory fleet, leaving the *Logos*, her battered vessel, a lone, flickering ember in the vast darkness.  Eva, the sole survivor, clung to the fading hope of a final transmission, a whispered echo of humanity across the unimaginable gulf to Earth.

Her gaunt face, framed by sweat-dampened, perpetually windblown hair, reflected the flickering console light, highlighting the weary etchings of survival carved into her features. The hum of the failing mainframe, a wounded beast gasping its last, was a dirge to her dwindling power reserves.  Every keystroke, every modulated burst of data, shaved precious seconds off the clock. 

She glanced at the holographic projection of the bridge, a spectral recreation shimmering above her console. It depicted her crew, frozen in their final moments of heroism, a tableau of camaraderie shattered by the Xylos’s icy wrath.  Dr. Chen, his ever-present smile replaced by a grimace of defiance as he shielded a fleeing engineer. Lieutenant Ramirez, his youthful optimism extinguished, yet his hand still outstretched in a futile grasp for the comms array. Their faces, once vibrant with the promise of discovery, were now poignant reminders of her solitary burden. Their sacrifice, a heavy anchor tethering her to this desperate act.

"Earth Command, this is *Logos*, Captain Rostova, transmitting on emergency frequency Delta-7," her voice, hoarse but resolute, crackled through the speakers, a fragile thread in the cosmic silence.  A technical ghost of a transmission,  it defied the odds, a defiant flare against the encroaching dark. "Acknowledging catastrophic mission failure...Xylos incursion...all hands...lost..."  Each word was a stone laid upon the altar of remembrance, a monument to their fallen comrades.

The console’s  limited bandwidth forced brutal choices.  Scientific data,  years of painstaking exploration logs,  had to be compressed into fragmented echoes,  a skeletal narrative of a universe unveiled, now forever incomplete.  Eva wrestled with the agonizing edit,  sacrificing  volumes of discovery to prioritize a single, vital piece: the Xylos’s unique energy signature,  a fingerprint of their terrifying  intelligence, a potential weapon  against an unforeseen future threat. This, she decided,  was her final, crucial bequest to humanity.

"The Xylos...non-corporeal, energy-based lifeform...pose an existential threat...signature attached...replication protocols...incomplete...but vital..."  Her fingers flew,  a ballet of desperation,  transmuting  complex data streams into a rudimentary  warning, a seed of knowledge sown in the fertile ground of  future research.  Tears,  unbidden  and stinging,  blurred her vision,  a physical manifestation of the agonizing dichotomy:  saving  data meant sacrificing  a personal eulogy,  a  final,  heartfelt farewell to her lost crew.

Time, a relentless predator,  nipped at her heels.  00:01:12.  A single,  unwavering photograph flickered to life on the auxiliary screen - a grinning  group shot  taken  months before,  the  *Logos*'s  crew bathed in the warm  gold of a nascent alien sun.  Eva’s  thumb hovered over the  transmission  key,  torn.  Should she  burden  Earth  with  her grief,  or  leave  them  with  the  stark  fact  of  loss  already  implied?  In  the  end,  humanity,  even  in  its  vast  distance,  deserved  a  touch  of  their  fragility,  their  connection.

"This is not just a report...it's a tombstone...for friends,  for family...chosen  to  explore  the  unknown,  and  found  only  eternity  in  its  heart.  Remember us,  Earth.  Remember our courage,  our  laughter...our  loss...lest  we  be  forgotten  stars  in  the  immensity."  Her voice,  barely  a  whisper  now,  carried  the  weight  of  a  lifetime  compressed  into  seconds.  The  transmission  key  clicked  down.  A  final,  aching  affirmation  sent  into  the  void.

00:00:00.  The  screens  guttered,  faded  to  black.  Silence,  absolute  and  consuming,   descended.  Eva  didn't  fight  the  yielding  darkness  that  followed.  She  closed  her  eyes,  a  small  smile  touching  her  lips.  In  the  grand  silence,  a  single  human  echo  remained,  a  fragile  resonance  carrying  the  unyielding  truth:  even  in  isolation  and  loss,  the  human  need  to  connect,  to  be  remembered,  burned  brightest  of  all.  Her  message  was  sent.  Her  sacrifice,  a  lullaby  of  hope  carried  on  the  cosmic  wind. [end of text]
