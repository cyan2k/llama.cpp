write a story about the discovery of a Euclid Class SCP
The discovery of a Euclid class SCP began when a Dr. Sophia Light was researching in her university's lab when she accidentally spilled chemicals which lead to a reality bubble to open. In this bubble, an Euclid class SCP-4691-J, a gelatinous blob with an amorphous body capable of taking the form of objects or objects that were destroyed was found.

The university was alerted to this situation, and the Foundation was contacted to investigate this occurrence. When they arrived on site, the Foundation researchers took a closer look at SCP-4691-J, and found out that the reality bubble could expand if the gelatinous mass was allowed to move outside the confines of the university.

To keep this reality bubble contained, the Foundation moved in quickly, securing the entire area. Dr. Light and other scientists were brought into the Foundation to further research the capabilities and origin of SCP-4691-J. Through the investigation, the Foundation was able to uncover the fact that the gelatinous mass was originally created as part of a project involving alternate dimensions by Dr. Light.

Dr. Light, being the brilliant scientist she is, was able to devise a containment protocol involving the usage of specialized equipment that was developed by the Foundation to prevent SCP-4691-J from escaping and expanding the reality bubble.

However, the Foundation also discovered that there was an instance of SCP-4691-J in another dimension, which could potentially break free at any moment and cause the destruction of both universes. A specialized task force was created to explore the possibility of retrieving SCP-4691-J from the alternate dimension, and successfully managed to secure the instance, bringing it back to containment within the Foundation.

This incident not only led to the discovery of a new Euclid class SCP but also brought the Foundation into contact with the alternate dimension. Further research on this incident and the alternate dimension is still ongoing at the SCP Foundation, and Dr. Sophia Light has become one of the Foundation's leading researchers in this field.
